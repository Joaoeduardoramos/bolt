Resources Needed for Front-end Architecture / Infrastructure Changes

1. crossbrowsertesting.com License Upgrade (Waiting Over a Week)

  Summary: In order to enforce mandatory front-end testing coverage (functional & visual regression testing) at the component level, we need to SIGNIFICANTLY increase our 1 test at a time license to allow for at LEAST 6+ parallel tests to be run, at a minimum.

  For reference: our current license ends up taking nearly an hour to run a small number of sample tests on Crossbrowsertesting.com vs around 10 minutes when testing the same suite out on Browserstack running 5 parallel tests at once.
  
  ** 10 browsers / devices on 3 different screen sizes
  
  
  Impact: front-end development on the new Design System + Pega.com Drupal 8 Redesign can't officially start until we have the capability to quickly run, and enforce, visual regression and functional testing coverage.
  
  
  
  2. Externally-Hosted Sandbox Servers (Waiting Over 4 Months)
  
  Summary: front-end development requires a few basic server environments in order to meet the demands and growing needs of the Digital Team.
  
  Specifically, these server environment(s) need to externally host a number of different front-end specific resources: 
  
    a. Static, externally accessible HTML / CSS / JS prototypes of front-end development work in progress (i.e. a new hosting environment for patterns.pega.com and patterns-dev.pega.com Pattern Lab instances) on a server environment that is publically viewable and accurately represents real world networking / performance conditions required for front-end testing, optimization and benchmarking work (ex. an HTTP/2 server with SSL enabled)
    
    b. The new, standalone documentation site for the Design System (outside of Pattern Lab) which provides resources, documentation and practical examples on how to get started and use the Design System. This will almost certainly be a static site generated by a PHP-based CMS like Spress or Grav that designers, content authors and developers will need to author and update.
