# bolt/objects-layout`
The all-in-one layout object in Bolt.

While very similar to the grid object, the layout object is essentially an all-in-one multi-tool for building out flexible layouts inside of and around components. In contrast, the grid object is typically only used for managing the overall layout of a page or section and has fewer configuration options (ie. guardrails) in place.

```
npm install @bolt/objects-layout
```
