# Bolt Component Generator (powered by Yeoman)

## Generating A New Component (only available inside the Bolt monorepo for now)

To generate a new Bolt component, run the following inside the root of the Bolt monorepo and walk through the CLI prompts.

```
yarn create-bolt-component
```

Note: There's still some work left to be done to finish deeply wiring up the Bolt build tools with task-specific generators like this one. Even more awesome updates involving this are still in progress!
