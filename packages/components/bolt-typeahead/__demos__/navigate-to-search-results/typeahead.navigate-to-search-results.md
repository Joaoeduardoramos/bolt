# Typeahead Demo: Navigate To Search Results {id=navigate-to-search-results}

Demos populating the `<bolt-typeahead>` component with a larger batch of results + customizing the `onSelected` behavior to always go to the search results page when selecting an item.

Unlike the other demo, only perfect matches will allow you to submit (via the submit button) / select a result.

For example, manually selecting / entering `Case Management` in the input field will allow you to submit via hitting enter / clicking on the search icon however entering in `Case Management2` instead would _not_ submit.
