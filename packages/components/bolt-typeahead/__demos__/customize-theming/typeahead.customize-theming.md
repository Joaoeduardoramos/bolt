## Demo: Customize Typeahead Theming {id=customize-theming}

By default, the Typeahead component inherits the color palette of the themed region it's in (ie. the parts of the page with a `.t-bolt-THEME` class) however using the `theme` prop we can override this behavior and manually pick which color theme to use.
