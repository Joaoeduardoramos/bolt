// Don't set z-index on body, because body can have links that need to set its own z-index. We'd want to keep z-index usage at a minimum to avoid endless conflicts. Background should be set to 0 because it's the lowest in the stacking order and 0 will not cover up body as long as body is set to position:relative.
