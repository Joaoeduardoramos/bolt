### Bug Fixes

* do not apply margin when icon container has 'is-empty' class ([d90dd91](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/d90dd91))
* fix-vertical alignment of links by setting bolt-link to "inline-block", vertical-align "bottom" ([7149e1c](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/7149e1c))
* remove extra whitespace in and around links in twig ([5288538](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/5288538))
* remove line breaks before and after lit-html template tags, causes unwanted space on inline elements ([9efef74](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/9efef74))


### Features

* add missing support for "isHeadline" to link ([c35a25b](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/c35a25b))
* deprecate "url" in link twig template, update to schema handled [#970](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/issues/970) ([e2d69c3](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/e2d69c3))
* if inner anchor has no "href", set it using the component's "href" prop ([63d1ab5](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/63d1ab5))
* replace "url" prop with "href" in JS, render anchor even if not "hasHref" ([5f8f6e3](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/5f8f6e3))
* revert "href" back to "url" in link component ([5f970c2](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/5f970c2))
* switch link and button to extend bolt-action, remove parts no longer needed ([2826575](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-link/commit/2826575))
