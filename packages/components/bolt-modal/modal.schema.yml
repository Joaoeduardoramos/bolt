#     description: Horizontal alignment of a single item.
#     enum:
#       - start
#       - center
#       - end

# note: props handling the alignment of content within a slot is TBD. I'm a little torn on the pros and cons to both approaches.



# note: Modals with content that doesn't fit within the available window space will always scroll the container if the `scrollable` prop isn't specified.
